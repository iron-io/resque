  # queue manipulation
  #

  # Pushes a job onto a queue. Queue name should be a string and the
  # item should be any JSON-able Ruby object.
  #
  # Resque works generally expect the `item` to be a hash with the following
  # keys:
  #
  #   class - The String name of the job to run.
  #    args - An Array of arguments to pass the job. Usually passed
  #           via `class.to_class.perform(*args)`.
  #
  # Example
  #
  #   Resque.push('archive', :class => 'Archive', :args => [ 35, 'tar' ])
  #
  # Returns nothing
  def push(queue, item)
    backend.push(queue, encode(item))
  end

  # Pops a job off a queue. Queue name should be a string.
  #
  # Returns a Ruby object.
  def pop(queue)
    decode backend.pop(queue)
  end

  # Returns an integer representing the size of a queue.
  # Queue name should be a string.
  def size(queue)
    backend.size(queue).to_i
  end

  # Returns an array of items currently queued. Queue name should be
  # a string.
  #
  # start and count should be integer and can be used for pagination.
  # start is the item to begin, count is how many items to return.
  #
  # To get the 3rd page of a 30 item, paginatied list one would use:
  #   Resque.peek('my_list', 59, 30)
  def peek(queue, start = 0, count = 1)
    result = backend.peek(queue, start, count)
    if count == 1
      decode result
    else
      result.map { |val| decode(val) }

  # job shortcuts

  #   b) responds to `queue`
  #
  # If either of those conditions are met, it will use the value obtained
  # from performing one of the above operations to determine the queue.

  # If no queue can be inferred this method will raise a `Resque::NoQueueError`

  # before_enqueue hook.

  # This method is considered part of the `stable` API.

  # `queue` should be the String name of the queue you're targeting.
